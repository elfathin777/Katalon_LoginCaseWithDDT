## 💼 Skills Demonstrated in This Project

This project highlights practical automation testing skills, including:

* Data-Driven Testing (DDT) implementation
* Use of **Custom Keywords** for reusable automation logic
* Web UI automation using Katalon Studio
* Test scenario validation with multiple data variations
* Clean and maintainable automation test structure
* Version control using GitHub

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Automate login functionality using a **single reusable test case**
* Separate test logic from test data for better maintainability
* Reduce code duplication using **Custom Keywords**
* Apply professional automation testing practices suitable for real projects

---

## 🧱 Tools & Technologies

* **Katalon Studio**
* **Groovy** (Test Cases & Custom Keywords)
* **CSV-based Test Data** (DDT)
* **Selenium WebDriver** (Katalon built-in)
* **GitHub**

## 🧪 Test Coverage (Current)

### Login Feature

Automated scenarios include:

* Successful login with valid credentials
* Failed login with invalid credentials
* Validation for empty username and/or password

All scenarios are executed through **one data-driven test case**, supported by **Custom Keywords** to keep the test logic clean and reusable.

> Additional scenarios and features will be added gradually.

## 🔁 Automation Approach

### Data-Driven Testing (DDT)

* One test logic, multiple data inputs
* External test data improves scalability and coverage
* Easy to extend without modifying test scripts

### Custom Keywords

* Encapsulate common actions (e.g., login steps, validation)
* Improve reusability and readability of test cases
* Support cleaner and more maintainable automation code

### Test Listeners

* Manage browser setup and teardown automatically
* Keep test cases focused on validation logic only

## ▶️ How to Run the Test

1. Open the project in **Katalon Studio**
2. Select the **Test Case** or **Test Suite**
3. Choose the target browser
4. Click **Run**
