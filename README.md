## 📌 Katalon Automation Testing Project

**(Data-Driven Testing for Login Feature)**

This project demonstrates an **automation testing implementation** using **Katalon Studio**, focused on applying **Data-Driven Testing (DDT)** for a login feature.

The project is designed to showcase fundamental automation testing skills, including test data management, scenario validation, and clean test logic structure.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Implement **data-driven automation testing** using Katalon Studio
* Validate multiple login scenarios using a **single automated test case**
* Demonstrate a structured and maintainable approach to test automation
* Serve as a **learning and portfolio project** for automation testing roles

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* **Katalon Studio**
* **Groovy** (Test Case scripting)
* **CSV files** for Data-Driven Testing
* **Selenium WebDriver** (Katalon built-in)
* **Git & GitHub** for version control

---

## 🧪 Testing Scope

### Login Feature Scenarios

The automated test covers the following scenarios using different input data:

* Valid login
* Invalid login
* Empty username and/or password validation

All scenarios are executed through **one reusable test case** driven by external test data.

---

## 🔁 Testing Approach

### Data-Driven Testing (DDT)

* Test logic is written once and executed multiple times using different data sets
* Test data is externalized in CSV files and managed through Katalon Test Data
* This approach improves test coverage while keeping the test logic simple and reusable
